grass (Genetic Regression Approximation through Summary Statistics) is an in-development R package to describe various regression models using only summary statistics.

Currently, grass supports the linear modeling of complex phenotypes defined via functions of other phenotypes.
Supported functions include:

* linear combinations (E.g. $\phi_1y_1 + \phi_2y_2$)
* products (E.g. $y_1\circ y_2$)
* logical combinations (E.g. $y_1\wedge y_2$ or $y_1\vee y_2$)

## Installation

You can install the in-development version of grass from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jackmwolf/grass")
```
